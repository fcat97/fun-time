# fun-time
A funny Kotlin Date library

---

**No more boring ğŸ˜´ Date, use FunTime ğŸ¥³ğŸ˜‹**

```kotlin
val a = 3 days later from today // after 3 days from today
val b = 5 minutes earlier from now // 5 minute earlier from now..

val t = one day earlier from today // returns yesterday as Date object

val s = now formatAs "hh:mm:ss YY-MMM-dd" // format a date
```

***Just for fun***
